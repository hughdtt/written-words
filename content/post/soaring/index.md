## ICARUS

The bold, capitalized words "LETTER OF ADMISSION: MINOS SPACE CORP" dominated my screen, a stark claim set against the cold glow of the digital background.

Haunted by the lingering tension from yesterday's conference, I decided to rip off the band-aid. Drawing in a breath, I forwarded a screenshot of the admission letter to Dad. As I hit send, a clatter of dishes, echoed from the kitchen. Great. He was still home; better to face this head-on.

Easing out of my room, I peeped down the long, artificially lit corridor. The dutiful maid-bots were humming and bustling around, engrossed in their routine tasks. And there, in the midst of it all, was Dad; his eyes glued to his tablet, lost in a world of his own.

"Good morning," I greeted, my voice teetering on the edge of normalcy and nervousness - the words dangling in the air like a fragile ornament.

"Morning," he reciprocated with his gaze still locked onto his screen; a silent rebuff to my greeting.

"Dad, I sent you something—" I began, my sentence hanging in the room like a thread, but before I could weave it into a conversation, he swiftly cut me off.

"I need to apologize," he murmured, the words rushed and indistinct. His eyes were seemingly half-focussed behind the tablet. "I...I didn't handle things well at the conference."

"No, Dad. I should apologize too," I chimed in, my voice heavy with surprise and a pang of guilt. "Anyway, about that message...have you seen it?" I redirected.

His gaze flickered up from the screen, those blue eyes reflecting a mixture of confusion and curiosity. He didn’t reply, so I rushed to fill the silence. "I need a legal guardian's signature for it. Since I'm, uh, technically not an adult. Could you sign it for me?"

His brow furrowed. "Ic—" he began, but I rushed on, too eager to finally get my secret off my chest.

"They've got a couple of humanitarian projects I'm excited about. I've even found some ways to incorporate some of your old prototypes," I added, the words tumbling out, trying to lure him in with my enthusiam.

Finally, he looked up, his eyes meeting mine. They bore a strange emptiness that made my heart beat uneasily. Was he going to say no?

He opened his mouth, the corners twitching as if battling unspoken words, paused, and closed it again. After a moment that seemed to stretch into eternity, he broke the silence. "Icarus," he finally said, his voice carrying a stern edge, "not MINOS. Anywhere but there."

My excitement deflated like a balloon, swiftly replaced with a cloud of confusion and a spritz of annoyance. "Why not?" I asked, the words echoing my bewilderment.

"All I can tell you is it's not the right fit for you," he said, his voice a steady stream in the sea of uncertainty. "If you don't find anything else, there's always a spot for you at Olympus."

"Dad, the whole point was to avoid nepotism. I don't want you to pull any strings for me," I retorted, frustration seeping into my voice.

I continued to stare at him, my eyes locked onto his with a silent plea for understanding. His struggle was evident in his grimace and the dull sheen in his eyes.

"Sorry," he eventually managed to let out, as if he was dragging the word from a deep well. He gave me a weak and lopsided smile. His eyes, this time his turn, pleaded for understanding.

A knot tightened in my stomach. This was supposed to be simple. Just one signature. Why couldn't he see that? He's so frustrating! Mum would've known exactly what to do.

But Mum wasn't here anymore, and I had to accept what was in front of me.

I sighed, deflated. "Okay, Dad. Not MINOS," I conceded, my voice barely more than a whisper, "I'll find something else."

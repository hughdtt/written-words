Drawing in a breath, I forwarded a screenshot of the admission letter to Dad. As I hit send, a clatter of dishes, echoed from the kitchen. Great. He was still home; better to face this head-on.</p><p>Easing out of my room, I peeped down the long, artificially lit corridor. The dutiful maid-bots were humming and bustling around, engrossed in their routine tasks. And there, in the midst of it all, was Dad; his eyes glued to his tablet, lost in a world of his own.</p><p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; I greeted, my voice teetering on the edge of normalcy and nervousness - the words dangling in the air like a fragile ornament.</p><p>&ldquo;Morning,&rdquo; he reciprocated with his gaze still locked onto his screen; a silent rebuff to my greeting.</p><p>&ldquo;Dad, I sent you somethingâ€”&rdquo; I began, my sentence hanging in the room like a thread, but before I could weave it into a conversation, he swiftly cut me off.</p><p>&ldquo;I need to apologize,&rdquo; he murmured, the words rushed and indistinct. His eyes were seemingly half-focussed behind the tablet. &ldquo;I&mldr;I didn&rsquo;t handle things well at the conference.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, Dad. I should apologize too,&rdquo; I chimed in, my voice heavy with surprise and a pang of guilt. &ldquo;Anyway, about that message&mldr;have you seen it?&rdquo; I redirected.</p><p>His gaze flickered up from the screen, those blue eyes reflecting a mixture of confusion and curiosity. He didnâ€™t reply, so I rushed to fill the silence. &ldquo;I need a legal guardian&rsquo;s signature for it. Since I&rsquo;m, uh, technically not an adult. Could you sign it for me?&rdquo;</p><p>His brow furrowed. &ldquo;Icâ€”&rdquo; he began, but I rushed on, too eager to finally get the secret off my chest.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got a couple of humanitarian projects I&rsquo;m excited about. I&rsquo;ve even found some ways to incorporate some of your old prototypes,&rdquo; I added, the words tumbling out, trying to lure him in with my enthusiam.</p><p>Finally, he looked up, his eyes meeting mine. They bore a strange emptiness that made my heart beat uneasily. Was he going to say no?</p><p>He opened his mouth, the corners twitching as if battling unspoken words, paused, and closed it again. After a moment that seemed to stretch into eternity, he broke the silence. &ldquo;Icarus,&rdquo; he finally said, his voice carrying a stern edge, &ldquo;not MINOS. Anywhere but there.&rdquo;</p><p>My excitement deflated like a balloon, swiftly replaced with a cloud of confusion and a spritz of annoyance. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; I asked, the words echoing my bewilderment.</p><p>&ldquo;All I can tell you is it&rsquo;s not the right fit for you,&rdquo; he said, his voice a steady stream in the sea of uncertainty. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t find anything else, there&rsquo;s always a spot for you at Olympus.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dad, the whole point was to avoid nepotism. I don&rsquo;t want you to pull any strings for me,&rdquo; I retorted, frustration seeping into my voice.</p><p>I continued to stare at him, my eyes locked onto his with a silent plea for understanding. His struggle was evident in his grimace and the dull sheen in his eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he eventually managed to let out, as if he was dragging the word from a deep well. He gave me a weak and lopsided smile. His eyes, this time his turn, pleaded for understanding.</p><p>A knot tightened in my stomach. This was supposed to be simple. Just one signature. Why couldn&rsquo;t he see that? He&rsquo;s so frustrating! Mum would&rsquo;ve known exactly what to do.</p><p>But Mum wasn&rsquo;t here anymore, and I had to accept what was in front of me.</p><p>I sighed, deflated. &ldquo;Okay, Dad. Not MINOS,&rdquo; I conceded, my voice barely more than a whisper, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find something else.&rdquo;</p><hr><h2 id=daedalus>DAEDALUS</h2><p>&ldquo;Okay, Dad. Not MINOS,&rdquo; Icarus, my little star said. The echoes of her words swept through the room, bouncing off the cold, metallic walls.</p><p>I knew that wasnâ€™t what she wanted. I could see her yearning for independence in those sparkly eyes of hers. Icarus was bright, radiant with potential, and on a fast-track course to engineering stardom. The kid was looking to fly high without getting too close to the sun, or in this case, her old man.</p><p>Her words echoed in the room, but it was her silent disappointment that seemed to scream at me.</p><p>I let it all slip away. I watched as she grew more distant. Words of apology, of explanation, clung to my throat, always seeming out of place. Every time I tried to reach out, circumstance, fear, or even my own pride stopped me. I knew what I had to do, I just didn&rsquo;t have the strength to do it. In my defense, I&rsquo;d never been great at maintenance. Spaceships? Sure. Father-daughter bonds? That&rsquo;s a different kind of engineering.</p><p>With a sigh heavier than a black hole, I eyed the tablet. The damning, bold words &ldquo;MINOS SPACE CORP&rdquo; were glaring back at me. Talk about a ghost from the past. It was like running into an ex at a supermarket, except this ex was a giant space corporation.</p><p>I admit, our friendship had been legendary. Two brilliant minds, together lighting the way to the stars. Now? A specter from my past. My biggest regret.</p><p>Minos, the Steve Jobs of space. The world saw him as a man who dared to dream beyond the stars. He was the visionary, and me? I was Wozniak, the sidekick. But hey, at least Wozniak hadn&rsquo;t gotten written out of the story.</p><p>You see, Minos and I had different dreams. He had wanted an empire, an unquenchable thirst for power and recognition. I dreamed of progress, of bettering the universe one small step at a time. And when those dreams clashed, I was removed from the narrative like a typo on a blueprint.</p><p>A sense of foreboding crept over me. I had tried to shield my little girl from the harshness of our world for as long as I could. But I knew she couldnâ€™t stay in the dark forever. She was too curious, too eager to learn, to explore. I&rsquo;d have to tell her the truth someday. And let me tell you, it&rsquo;s easier to land a spaceship on a comet than to navigate throught that teenage emotional minefield.</p><p>&ldquo;One day, kiddo. One day youâ€™ll understand.&rdquo; I muttered to myself, hoping the universe would take a rain check on this difficult conversation.</p><p>With Icarus gone, the silence was so dense I could almost hear the dust settling. But I was determined. The fractures in our relationship were deep, but not irreparable. It was going to be tough, harder than any challenge I had faced in my career. But for my little star, it was worth it. I owed her that much.</p><hr></section><footer class=article-footer><section class=article-tags><a href=/tags/serialized/>Serialized</a>
